# TicTacToeTah

TicTacToeTah is a twist on TicTacToe which requires you to think in three dimensions. Built using C# and WPF. It supports playing against your friends either locally or online and also has a challenging computer artifical intelligence.

# History
This is a game I built in 2007 when learning WPF. It supported online play back then (with direct peer to peer communication) but that has not been tested in a long long long time. I am posting the description of it I wrote back then for historical value.


## About

TicTacToeTah is not you mama's TicTacToe.  It has an extra dimension (the Tah). That makes this a three dimensional version of the classic game. To win you must get 4 X's or O's in a row. The game presents you with four 4x4 TicTacToe board.  You must connect X's or O's in or between these boards.  Think of these boards as being stacked one on top of the other.  This may seem easy but it is quite a challenge.

2. Single player and multi-player modes
3. Online mode (play with your friend from across the intertubes)
4. 4 levels of AI difficulty
